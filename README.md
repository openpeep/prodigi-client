## Prodigi's Live and Sandbox Environments
Prodigi provides two working environments. One for production (Live) and one for development purpose, called Sandbox. By default Prodigi Client is running with `sandbox` set `true`, which will route all requests to `api.sandbox.prodigi.com`, whereas for production environment the base endpoint is `api.prodigi.com`. Read about [Sandbox / Live environments](https://www.prodigi.com/print-api/docs/reference/#environments-sandbox).

## Quick Example
```python
import prodigi

var client = Prodigi()
```

### üëë Discover Nim language
<strong>What's Nim?</strong> Nim is a statically typed compiled systems programming language. It combines successful concepts from mature languages like Python, Ada and Modula. [Find out more about Nim language](https://nim-lang.org/)

<strong>Why Nim?</strong> Performance, fast compilation and C-like freedom. We want to keep code clean, readable, concise, and close to our intention. Also a very good language to learn in 2022.
